# Image-Reconstruction
MATLAB/GNU Octave script for reconstructing an image based on the magnitude and phase spectra of its DFT. 

Note: If you are using MATLAB, the image processing toolbox must be installed in order to run the script. Similarily, if you are using GNU Octave the image package must be installed and loaded.
